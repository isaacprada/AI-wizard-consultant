# AI Wizard Consultant for SMEs

Building AI course project

## Summary

AI powered auto-consultant for the first stages of management consultancy for SMEs. Most of the problems faced by SMEs are common at this stage and having an AI consultant that they can use to obtain a first diagnosis and a first set of proposed improvement measures reduces the cost of hiring a well-established consultancy firm, something most SMEs cannot afford to do. Later on a human consultant would come into play for sure! 


## Background

SMEs are the core of the economy in most countries, amounting to over 90% of the companies in many nations. Most SMEs face similar challenges and sources of misperformance (Pareto would say 80% of their problems are common to all SMEs) that can be handled using very similar improvement measures with minor tweaking to adapt to the particular case of each SME. I have many years of management consultancy experience, based on the management method I learnt as an engineer in Formula 1, one of the most challenging sectors, and my own experience as entrepreneur and I have developed a proprietary methodology, called Competitive Manager, which analyses the 8 core areas of any business and proposes detailed improvement measures. This is the baseline for the AI consultant I propose. 

In practice, key aspects to be dealt with as part of my management consulting with the highest potential for impact usually include some or all of the following: strategy definition (focused mainly on prioritization and clarity on the best detailed path forward for the company, projects it should focus on and projects to be discarded, left on stand-by or hired outside the company) and implementation design, optimum team architecture with special emphasis on differential models (more so after COVID-19) such as staff on demand and virtual or hybrid teams and analysis of key team personnel, high-level financial analysis and proposal of ad-hoc key financial and performance indicators, implementing Objective and Key Results (OKR) or similar methodologies to set and supervise company goals and, finally, overcoming growth related challenges and other productivity daily misperformances such as inefficient meetings, bad stress and uncertainty handling (key aspects for instance in Formula 1), poor innovation techniques, priorities that keep changing weekly, lack of clarity and bad or slow decision making by top management. 

The first stage is to analyse the current situation of the company and give a first diagnosis on the key areas to be tackled or with highest improvement potential. This can be done with the AI consultant and is already of very high value for the SME, which will receive a proposal with improvement measures at a reduced cost compared to hiring a well established consultancy firm. These measures come with a detailed explanation on how they should be implemented. The results obtained in this first phase will hopefully give confidence to the SME to invest a bit more in a second phase with human consultants!

## How is it used?

The AI consultant will be used primarily by SME CEOs or C-level executives. They will input their company data following a structured questionnaire and this will be the basis for the first stage diagnosis. Natural Language Processing (NLP) will have to be used to a certain extent to collect and filter the input data. Therafter I envision the use of neural network model for the AI consultant itself.

## Data sources and AI methods

A first set of training data for the first optimization iterations of the AI model will be input by our team based on real cases of SME we have analyzed in the past.
Then once we have a minimum viable version which appears to work more or less correctly we can start asking real companies to input their own data with our guidance.

## Challenges

This AI-consultant is a wizard, which sounds smart, but it is not an experienced human consultant. It cannot pick up many of the nuances and details that make consulting an art, based on experience and methods, but not pure magic. However, for the first stages of a typical management consultancy project for an SME I have found over the years that most of the initial main problems and issues are common to most SMEs and an AI consultant can analyze them and offer a first-stage set of measures which can already have important positive results on the SME. However this consultant is not able to analyze complex or mixed problems or larger companies in general. Thankfully that's where humans can really help! 

## What next?

My dream is for this AI consultant to become widely accessible for many SMEs, also in developing and under-developped countries, so that more data is gathered and can better help more SMEs. This is when funding would be required, to scale up the project and launch a pro-bono service for low-resource SMEs worldwide. Of course, from a technical standpoint, help and proposals from other AI experts and from other experienced management consultants would be very fruitful. Want to join and add a bit of your art and magic to the project?
